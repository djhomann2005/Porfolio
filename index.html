            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                DJ is an aspiring full-stack web developer. Starting his professional career in the fitness industry,
                he decided to change paths to involve his long-term hobby: computers. Having designed websites for fun
                in the early days of HTML, DJ decided to revisit the art of building engaging and inviting websites. 
                DJ is pursuing certifications in front-end and back-end web development in order to reach this goal.

                        Credit Validator takes input from the user on the webpage and determines if the credit card
                        number is valid. It uses JavaScript on the front end to automatically validate the number. 
                        The validation process uses arrays and loop iteration starting with a check digit following
                        a specific formula to check the number. The JavaScript code is also set up to test batches
                        of numbers and outputting which credit card companies have issued invalid cards, though this
                        functionality is not implemented on the website.

                        This project demonstrates understanding of JavaScript, input and output to a webpage using 
                        JavaScript, as well as using loops to iterate through collections of data.

                        Mixed messages outputs a random combination of messages when the user clicks 'Generate Message'.   
                        This message is a combination of weather forecast (fictional), a motivational quote, and a
                        Powerball number. The temperature and windspeed are randomly generated numbers within a range
                        which are then combined with a string to make the message. Similarly, the Powerball numbers are
                        randomly generated within a range, but also will not duplicate numbers in the white balls. The 
                        motivational quote comes from an array of quotes.
                        
                        This project demonstrates the usage of JavaScript to react to user input, run functions behind
                        the scene (including randomly generating numbers), and change elements on a webpage. HTML is also
                        being used to create the structure of the website, allowing user input and providing an area for
                        output to be displayed.
